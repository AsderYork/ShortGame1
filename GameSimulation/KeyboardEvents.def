/**!
This is a dangerous zone!

So we want to generate an entire event and even register it afterwards with as less code
duplication, as possible.

For that, we use 3 files.
This is a first one. It contains only definitions of class that will be created.

Then KeyboardEvents.h will create actual class definitions and, probably, some special way to deserialize this events
from EventBase.
